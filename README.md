# *Python - Practice and Learning Repository*

Welcome to my **"Python"** repository, a space where I compile practical activities developed throughout my Python learning journey. This repository is part of my professional portfolio and aims to demonstrate my technical skills, understanding of key concepts, and application of fundamental libraries for analytical and computational problem-solving.

---
##  *Repository Objective*

**To demonstrate proficiency in:**

* Data analysis
* Applied statistics with Python and Mastery of the Python scientific stack (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy)
* Effective data visualization

  
## *Repository Contents*

The following are the main topics and tools covered:

### 1. *Data Manipulation with Pandas*

* Reading and writing CSV files
* Data cleaning and transformation
* Boolean masking, Conditional filtering and column selection
* Grouping with `groupby()` and Joining datasets using `merge()` and `concat()`

### *2. Numerical and Statistical Analysis with NumPy and SciPy*

* Use of `np.array`, `reshape`, masking, broadcasting
* Descriptive statistics: mean, median, standard deviation
* Z-scores with `scipy.stats.zscore()`
* T-tests, correlations, probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson)

### 3. *Data Visualization with Matplotlib*

* Line charts, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, boxplots
* Customizing titles, axes, and legends
* Using subplots for comparative visualizations

### 4. *Core Python Concepts*

* Data types: lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets
* Common methods per type (`.append()`, `.remove()`, `.get()`, `.add()`, etc.)
* Conditional statements and loops (`if`, `for`, `while`)
* Custom functions, recursion, list comprehensions, error handling, and iteration

### 5. *Real-World Data Processing*

* Analysis of datasets, data preprocessing, and cleaning
* Handling missing values and converting categorical data to numerical (`.astype('category').cat.codes`, `get_dummies()`)
